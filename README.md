# DemoPortal

This demo project provides a basic React page built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui-style components. It lists API documentation items and shows a floating chat window placeholder.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (if your environment allows network access) from the
`src/front_end` directory:

```bash
cd src/front_end
npm install
```

Start the development server from the same directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
